# CPSC 210 Final Project

## Proposal

A personal **agenda application** designed to help keep students on track with their courses
and make personalized to-do lists. This application is intended for all UBC students and especially those who need extra
assistance in managing their time and meeting deadlines. With the move to online learning, many courses use various
platforms to deliver course content. With this application, you will now be able to manage your tasks for all your 
courses in one spot.

*Features*:

- A list of your currently enrolled classes
- A personalized todo list with due dates
- Individual course tabs with tasks specific to the course

Phase 4: Task 2

I have implemented a robust design for the getCourse() method in the CourseList class and the getTask() method in the
TaskList class. The exceptions are caught in the TasksPage class in the deletingAction() and completingAction() methods,
as well as in the CoursesPage class in the deleteHelper() method.

Phase 4: Task 3
 
- introduce a super class that is abstract to remove duplicating methods in the TaskList & CourseList classes, and the
  TasksPage & CoursesPage classes. These classes would extend the abstract super class and provide different
  implementations for methods that require the differentiation (such as the different positions for certain buttons/
  text fields between the TasksPage & CoursesPage).
